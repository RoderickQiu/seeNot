# seeNot 不见君

seeNot, next-gen distraction-blocker for Android.

## What's it for

- There are always times when you think a part of an app is distractive but you cannot leave the app
  as a whole.
- Those problems that cannot be solved by traditional solutions like "Screen Time" can be solved by
  this Android app.
- Using Android Accessibility API, things are made easy.
