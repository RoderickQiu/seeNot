# seeNot 不见君

seeNot, next-gen distraction-blocker for Android.
(Origin name: 见否, changed due to trademark issues.)

## What's it for

- There are always times when you think a part of an app is distractive but you cannot leave the app as a whole.
- Those problems that cannot be solved by app blockers like Apple's "Screen Time" can be solved by this Android app.
- And this way is as simple as using an ad-blocker for the web.
